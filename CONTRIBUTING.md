You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. For more information, see the [OpenJSF Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/contributing/contributing-code.md#contributor-license-agreement).
